All your data belongs to you and resides inside a "Region" inside your own cloud account. Isthari will NEVER have any kind of access to your data, it's protected all time by the cloud standard security features.

You can deploy a region in any datacenter of the main cloud providers, including: AWS, Azure and GCP.

You can even have regions defined in different providers. For example, you can user AWS for North America, Azure for Europe and GCP for Asia
