<p>Minimal Mistakes has been developed to be 100% compatible with hosting a site on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. To get up and running with a new GitHub repository quickly, follow these steps or jump ahead to the <a href="http://localhost:4000/docs/installation/">full installation guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fork-the-theme">Fork the Theme</h2>

<p>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/fork">Minimal Mistakes theme</a>, then rename the repo to <strong>USERNAME.github.io</strong> &#8212; replacing <strong>USERNAME</strong> with your GitHub username.</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Your Jekyll site should be viewable immediately at <a href="http://USERNAME.github.io">http://USERNAME.github.io</a>. If it&#8217;s not, you can force a rebuild by <strong>Customizing Your Site</strong> (see below for more details).</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re hosting several Jekyll based sites under the same GitHub username you will have to use Project Pages instead of User Pages. Essentially you rename the repo to something other than <strong>USERNAME.github.io</strong> and create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch off of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>. For more details on how to set things up check <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">GitHub&#8217;s documentation</a>.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>ProTip:</strong> Be sure to <a href="https://github.com/blog/1377-create-and-delete-branches">delete</a> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch if you forked Minimal Mistakes. This branch contains the documentation and demo site for the theme and you probably don&#8217;t want that showing up in your repo.</p>

<h2 id="customize-your-site">Customize Your Site</h2>

<p>Open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> found in the root of the repo and edit anything under <strong>Site Settings</strong>. For a full explanation of every setting be sure to read the <a href="http://localhost:4000/docs/configuration/"><strong>Configuration</strong></a> section, but for now let&#8217;s just change the site&#8217;s title.</p>

<p>Committing a change to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with Jekyll. It should then be viewable a few seconds later at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://USERNAME.github.io</code>.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You&#8217;ve successfully forked the theme and are up an running with GitHub Pages. Now you&#8217;re ready to add content and customize the site further.</p>
