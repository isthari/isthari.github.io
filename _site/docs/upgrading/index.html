<p>Currently there is no good way of upgrading the theme without doing a bit of manual work. The future looks promising now that <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/"><strong>gem based themes</strong></a> have landed with Jekyll <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v3.2</code>, but for now here&#8217;s some suggestions on how to handle updates.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Gemified Theme</strong>: A future version of Minimal Mistakes will suppor the new Jekyll theme system. A few key features like theme assets (eg. fonts, images, and JavaScript) and support for GitHub Pages are currently missing for this enhancement to happen now. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2 id="use-git">Use Git</h2>

<p>If you want to get the most out of the Jekyll + GitHub Pages workflow, then you&#8217;ll need to utilize Git. To pull down theme updates you must first ensure there&#8217;s an upstream remote. If you forked the theme&#8217;s repo then you&#8217;re likely good to go.</p>

<p>To double check, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git remote -v</code> and verify that you can fetch from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">origin https://github.com/isthari/isthari.github.io.git</code>.</p>

<p>To add it you can do the following:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git remote add upstream https://github.com/isthari/isthari.github.io.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="pull-down-updates">Pull Down Updates</h3>

<p>Now you can pull any commits made to theme&#8217;s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch with:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git pull upstream master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Depending on the amount of customizations you&#8217;ve made after forking, there&#8217;s likely to be merge conflicts. Work through any conflicting files Git flags, staging the changes you wish to keep, and then commit them.</p>

<h2 id="update-files-manually">Update Files Manually</h2>

<p>Another way of dealing with updates is <a href="https://github.com/isthari/isthari.github.io/archive/master.zip">downloading the theme</a> &#8212; replacing your layouts, includes, and assets with the newer ones manually. To be sure that you don&#8217;t miss any changes it&#8217;s probably a good idea to review the theme&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/isthari/isthari.github.io/commits/master">commit history</a> to see what&#8217;s changed since.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick checklist of the important folders/files you&#8217;ll want to be mindful of:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>&#160;</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts</code></td>
      <td>Replace all. Apply edits if you customized any layouts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_includes</code></td>
      <td>Replace all. Apply edits if you customized any includes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets</code></td>
      <td>Replace all. Apply edits if you customized stylesheets or scripts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_data/navigation.yml</code></td>
      <td>Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_data/ui-text.yml</code></td>
      <td>Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code></td>
      <td>Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions.</td>
    </tr>
