To ingest the data you have 2 different approaches:


- Use your existing ETL tools with cloud and Big Data support, like Oracle Data Integrator, Microsoft SQL Integration Service, Powercenter or many others

- Use the built-in ETL SaaS already provided by the solution and based on Apache Airflow
 

If you want to ingest on premise data, you must first enabled the secure VPC connection from the cloud to your data center, check the Administrator Guide, connection to your assets

 

If you want to ingest cloud data sources, you can go directly to the Apache Airflow Guide
